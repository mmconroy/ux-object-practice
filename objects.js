    Gardening!

    You were hired to work as a landscaper for a large estate.

    See garden.jpg

    The owner wants you to help them organize their gardens.

    They have decided there will be three gardens: the rose arbor, 
    the perennial garden, and the slope planters.

    You want to use your newly learned programming skills to make
    this job easier.  

    Complete the following exercises to make your work on the garden easier.

    Creating a plant

    The createEstate() has already been written for you, which returns an object representing the entire estate.
    The estate contains three collections of plants: 
    the roseArbor, the perennialGarden, and the slopePlanters.

    Now complete the function addPlantToEstate()
    This should decide, based upon the plant's properties, where to put the plant in the estate.  

    The rose arbor should contain all of the roses.
    The perennial garden should contain only perennials.  However, the perennial garden doesn't get that much sun.  
    No plants with an amountOfSunNeeded greater than 5 should be placed in the perennial garden.
    The rest of the plans should be placed in the slop planters.

    Exercise Three

    The owner wants to have an easy way to hear about the plants in their garden.

    So you decide to write some functions which describe the plants.

    Complete the describePlant(), describePlants(), and describeGarden() functions below.

    They should each return a string, which is a readible english paragraph that nicely describes
    the visual features of the plant or a list of plants, or the entire estate.

    Feel free to be as elaborate as you wish!

    If you want examples of different plants, set a breakpoint and run the test. 
    It will go through several example plants.
    
    Try to have as little redundent code as possible! 
    
    Hint: describeEstate can call describeGarden which can call describePlant

    read up on them here: https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-template-literals/
