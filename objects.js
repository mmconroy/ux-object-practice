    Object Practice

    Gardening!

    You were hired to work as a landscaper for a large estate.

    See garden.jpg

    The owner wants you to help them organize their gardens.

    They have decided there will be three gardens: the rose arbor, 
    the perennial garden, and the slope planters.

    You want to use your newly learned programming skills to make
    this job easier.  

    Complete the following exercises to make your work on the garden easier.

    Exercise One

    Creating a plant

    In order to keep track of your plants, you need to store them in your program.
    Complete the createPlant() function, which returns an object representing a plant.
    It should include all of the properties listed in the comment above the function.
*/
/**
 * createPlant - Produces an object respresenting a plant.  It should have the following properties:
 * @param {string} type - The Type of plant.  Possible values are [ "rose", "orchid", "lily", "lavender", "poppy", "begonia", "snapdragon", "marigold"]
 * @param {boolean} isPerennial - A boolean showing if the plant is a perennial or not
 * @param {string} leafDescription - A visual description of the leaves
 * @param {string} leafColor - A string representing the leaf color
 * @param {string} flowerColor - A string representing the color of the flower
 * @param {string} flowerDescription - A visual description of the flower
 * @param {number} gallonsWaterPerWeek - 0.0 to 3.0, representing the number of gallons of water needed per week for the plant
 * @param {number} amountOfSunNeeded - 0 to 10, representing the amount of sun needed

    Exercise Two

    The owner wants you to decide where to put every new plant they get.

    Each plant must go in one of the three gardens of the estate.

    The createEstate() has already been written for you, which returns an object representing the entire estate.
    The estate contains three collections of plants: 
    the roseArbor, the perennialGarden, and the slopePlanters.

    Now complete the function addPlantToEstate()
    This should decide, based upon the plant's properties, where to put the plant in the estate.  

    The rose arbor should contain all of the roses.
    The perennial garden should contain only perennials.  However, the perennial garden doesn't get that much sun.  
    No plants with an amountOfSunNeeded greater than 5 should be placed in the perennial garden.
    The rest of the plans should be placed in the slop planters.

}

/* ------------------------------------------------
    Exercise Three

    The owner wants to have an easy way to hear about the plants in their garden.

    So you decide to write some functions which describe the plants.

    Complete the describePlant(), describePlants(), and describeGarden() functions below.

    They should each return a string, which is a readible english paragraph that nicely describes
    the visual features of the plant or a list of plants, or the entire estate.

    Feel free to be as elaborate as you wish!

    If you want examples of different plants, set a breakpoint and run the test. 
    It will go through several example plants.
    
    Try to have as little redundent code as possible! 
    
    Hint: describeEstate can call describeGarden which can call describePlant

    Hint2: YOu can use Template literals here to make this easy! If you have not used those yet,
    read up on them here: https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-template-literals/  
    `A ${plant.name} which has ....`
    But you can just use string concatenation too   "A " + plant.name + " which has ..."

function describePlant(plant) {

    to need per week.

    Exercise Five

    Clone a plant

    The botanist of the estate wants more colors of roses, so they have devised a way to
    alter the color of a plant.
    They want you to clone each of the roses in the garden giving them more
    elaborate colors.

    First, complete cloneRose().
    Given a plant, this should clone it and return a copy with a new color.

    Complete cloneAllTheRosesAndChangeTheirColors().

    Make sure your algorithm does not clone or change the color of flawed plants!

 *
 * This should return a new object, which is a clone of the given plant.
